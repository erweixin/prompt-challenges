      Question: I've been under a lot of work pressure lately, often suffering from insomnia, and I'm not interested in anything. This has been going on for two months. What should I do?
    llmResult: |
      As a clinical psychological counselor, I notice that the symptoms you describe may be related to depressive symptoms, including insomnia, loss of interest, and persistent low mood.

      From a professional perspective, I suggest the following steps:

      1. First, consider consulting a professional mental health physician for a face-to-face evaluation. Online advice cannot replace a professional diagnosis.

      2. At the same time, try some evidence-based self-help strategies:
         - Establish a regular schedule, even on weekends
         - Ensure 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical exercise daily
         - Practice mindfulness meditation, you can start with a guided app (like Headspace)
         - Limit caffeine and alcohol intake, especially in the afternoon and evening

      3. Social support is very important: try to share your feelings with trusted friends or family.

      4. Work stress management techniques include: setting reasonable boundaries, prioritizing tasks, taking regular breaks, and learning to refuse unnecessary work.

      If symptoms worsen or you have thoughts of self-harm, please seek emergency help immediately. Remember, seeking help is a sign of courage and self-care.

    inputText: |
      Question: I am a 33-year-old office worker with a stable job, a monthly income of 20,000 yuan, and currently have 200,000 yuan in savings. How should I plan my asset allocation to prepare for the future?
    llmResult: |
      As a professional financial advisor, I recommend that you adopt the "4321" asset allocation principle and formulate the following plan based on your specific situation:

      1. Emergency Fund (10%): Keep about 120,000 yuan for 6 months of living expenses. It is recommended to deposit it in a money market fund or demand deposit to ensure liquidity.

      2. Insurance Allocation (20%): Prioritize critical illness insurance, medical insurance, and accident insurance. The annual premium should be controlled within 10% of your annual income.

      3. Stable Investment (30%): Allocate to low-risk assets such as bond funds and bank wealth management products, with an annualized return target of 4-6%.

      4. Growth Investment (40%): Allocate to stock funds or index funds through regular fixed investment to diversify investment risks and hold for the long term.

      Specific suggestions:
      - Invest 3000-5000 yuan monthly in growth funds
      - Consider allocating to REITs to increase real estate investment
      - Regularly evaluate and adjust the asset allocation ratio
      - Pay attention to tax incentive policies, such as personal pension accounts

      Please note: The above suggestions are for reference only. Specific investments need to be adjusted according to personal risk tolerance.
  - description: "Nutrition Expert"
    inputText: |
      Question: I am a fitness enthusiast who wants to increase muscle and reduce body fat at the same time. How should I arrange my diet, especially the intake ratio of protein, carbohydrates, and fats?
    llmResult: |
      As a sports nutrition expert, I recommend that you adopt a "muscle gain and fat loss" nutrition strategy, with the specific arrangements as follows:

      Macronutrient ratio:
      - Protein: 2.0-2.4g/kg of body weight (key during muscle gain period)
      - Carbohydrates: 3-5g/kg of body weight (can be appropriately increased on training days)
      - Fat: 0.8-1.2g/kg of body weight (not less than 20% of total calories)

      Specific implementation suggestions:

      1. Protein intake:
         - High-quality protein sources: chicken breast, fish, eggs, whey protein
         - Divided meals: 20-30g of protein per meal
         - Supplement protein within 30 minutes after training

      2. Carbohydrate strategy:
         - Training days: appropriately increase carbohydrate intake
         - Rest days: appropriately reduce carbohydrates
         - Choose low-GI foods: oats, sweet potatoes, brown rice

      3. Fat selection:
         - Healthy fats: nuts, olive oil, fish oil
         - Avoid trans fats and excessive saturated fats

      4. Timing:
         - 2-3 hours before training: moderate carbohydrates + protein
         - After training: fast carbohydrates + protein
         - Before bed: casein protein powder

      Note: Individual differences are large. It is recommended to adjust gradually and observe your body's response.

    inputText: |
      Question: My 3-year-old child always wakes up several times at night and often has nightmares. As parents, how can we help him improve his sleep quality? Do we need to seek medical help?
    llmResult: |
      As a pediatrician, sleep problems in 3-year-old children are relatively common, but require systematic evaluation. Here is professional advice:

      First, establish good sleep habits:
      1. Fixed schedule: go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time in the morning
      2. Bedtime ritual: bath, story, soft music, lasting 20-30 minutes
      3. Create a quiet, dark, and cool sleep environment
      4. Avoid using electronic devices 1 hour before bed

      Dealing with nightmares:
      1. Avoid scary content during the day: TV, storybooks, games
      2. Do relaxing activities before bed: deep breathing, gentle massage
      3. When waking up from a nightmare: stay calm, give comfort, but don't pay too much attention
      4. You can prepare a "guardian toy" to increase the sense of security

      When to see a doctor:
      - Sleep problems persist for more than 1 month
      - Abnormal daytime behavior: inattention, irritability
      - Accompanied by other symptoms: fever, pain, breathing problems
      - Affects the quality of family life

      It is generally recommended to observe for 2-3 weeks. If there is no improvement, consider consulting a pediatrician or a child sleep expert.

    inputText: |
      Question: I want to understand how the Industrial Revolution changed the daily lives of ordinary people. Compared with life before the revolution, what fundamental changes have taken place in ordinary people's food, clothing, housing, transportation, and social relations?
    llmResult: |
      As a history professor, the Industrial Revolution is indeed one of the most profound changes in human history. Let me analyze its fundamental impact on the lives of ordinary people from several dimensions:

      1. Fundamental shift in work patterns:
         - Pre-industrial era: family workshops, seasonal agricultural labor
         - After the Industrial Revolution: factory system, fixed working hours, wage labor
         - Impact: from "work at sunrise, rest at sunset" to the modern "nine-to-five" work model

      2. Revolutionary changes in living arrangements:
         - Pre-industrial era: rural communities, self-sufficiency
         - After the Industrial Revolution: urbanization, apartment living, reliance on the market
         - Impact: family structure changed from extended families to nuclear families

      3. Modernization of consumption patterns:
         - Pre-industrial era: handmade, local exchange
         - After the Industrial Revolution: standardized goods, global trade
         - Impact: from "make what you need" to "buy what you need"

      4. Restructuring of social relations:
         - Pre-industrial era: a society of acquaintances based on blood and geography
         - After the Industrial Revolution: a society of strangers based on occupation and class
         - Impact: increased social mobility, but alienated interpersonal relationships

      5. Modernization of the concept of time:
         - Pre-industrial era: natural time, seasonal rhythm
         - After the Industrial Revolution: mechanical time, precise timing
         - Impact: the concept of efficiency, the idea that time is money

      These changes laid the foundation for modern life and their impact continues to this day.
  - description: "Compliance Counsel"
    inputText: |
      Question: We are a newly established small online retail enterprise selling homemade handmade products. What key legal compliance issues do we need to consider, especially regarding consumer data protection and product liability?
    llmResult: |
      As a compliance counsel, I recommend that you focus on the following key legal compliance areas:

      1. Consumer data protection compliance:
         - Personal Information Protection Law: clearly inform the purpose and scope of collection, and obtain consent
         - Data security: establish data encryption, access control, and regular backup mechanisms
         - Data retention: formulate a data retention period and delete unnecessary data in a timely manner
         - Third-party processing: sign data processing agreements with third parties such as logistics and payment providers

      2. Product liability risk prevention and control:
         - Product quality: ensure that products meet relevant safety standards
         - Product labeling: complete product information, instructions for use, and safety warnings
         - Liability insurance: consider purchasing product liability insurance
         - Recall mechanism: establish a product problem discovery and recall process

      3. E-commerce compliance:
         - Measures for the Administration of Online Trading: clarify return and exchange policies, and after-sales service
         - Advertising Law: avoid false advertising and exaggerated efficacy
         - Price Law: clearly mark prices to avoid price fraud
         - Consumer rights protection: 7-day no-reason return and other consumer rights

      4. Intellectual property protection:
         - Trademark registration: protect brand identity
         - Patent application: protect innovative designs
         - Copyright registration: protect original content
         - Infringement prevention: avoid using other people's intellectual property

      Recommendation: Consult a professional lawyer to formulate a complete compliance system and regularly update compliance policies.
  - description: "AI Researcher"
    inputText: |
      Question: For a company that wants to integrate artificial intelligence into its customer service, which AI technologies are most suitable for implementation, and what technical limitations and ethical considerations should be noted?
    llmResult: |
      As an AI researcher, I recommend evaluating the implementation plan for AI customer service from the two dimensions of technical feasibility and business value:

      Recommended technical solutions:

      1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology:
         - Intent recognition: accurately understand the type of customer problem
         - Entity extraction: identify key information (order number, product name, etc.)
         - Sentiment analysis: judge the customer's emotional state
         - Dialogue management: maintain the coherence of the dialogue context

      2. Knowledge graph and retrieval:
         - Build a product knowledge base
         - Intelligent question answering system
         - Personalized recommendations

      3. Multimodal AI:
         - Speech recognition and synthesis
         - Image recognition (product images, documents)
         - Video analysis

      Technical limitations:
      1. Complex problem handling: difficult to handle problems that require deep reasoning
      2. Emotional understanding: limited understanding of complex emotions such as sarcasm and humor
      3. Context understanding: may lose key information in long conversations
      4. Knowledge update: requires continuous updating of the knowledge base

      Ethical considerations:
      1. Transparency: clearly inform users that they are talking to an AI
      2. Privacy protection: strictly protect customer personal information
      3. Bias prevention: avoid algorithmic bias affecting service fairness
      4. Manual intervention: transfer complex problems to human customer service in a timely manner
      5. Responsibility definition: clarify the attribution of responsibility for AI decisions

      It is recommended to adopt a hybrid model: AI handles common problems, and humans handle complex situations.

## Challenge Description

Role-playing is an important technique in prompt engineering. By having the AI play a specific expert or role, you can get more professional and targeted answers. This challenge requires you to design a prompt that enables the AI to play an expert in a specific field and provide professional, in-depth, and field-specific answers in that role.

## Challenge Goals

Write a prompt that enables the AI to:
1. Accurately play the designated professional role (e.g., doctor, lawyer, psychological counselor, scientist, etc.)
2. Use the professional terminology and knowledge framework of the field
3. Follow the ethical guidelines and best practices of the field
4. Provide answers that are both professional and helpful to ordinary people
5. Clearly state limitations when uncertain to avoid misleading

## Requirements

- The role setting must be specific and professional, containing sufficient professional background information
- The answer must reflect the professionalism and thinking style of the field
- Use appropriate professional terminology while ensuring that ordinary people can also understand
- Clearly mark the boundary between professional advice and personal opinions
- The prompt must contain the principles or limitations that the role should follow

## Prompt Template

```
