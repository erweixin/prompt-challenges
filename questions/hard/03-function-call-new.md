# Function Call

## ðŸ”´ Hard

### Challenge Description

Function calling allows AI to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly extending its capabilities. This challenge requires you to design a prompt that enables an AI to correctly understand a user's intent and translate it into a specific function call, including selecting the right tool and extracting the correct parameters.

### Challenge Goals

Write a prompt that enables AI to:
1.  Accurately identify the user's intent and map it to the correct tool or function.
2.  Correctly extract all necessary parameters from the user's query.
3.  Format the function call correctly according to the tool's specification.
4.  Handle multi-step tasks that require sequential tool calls.
5.  Gracefully handle ambiguous requests or missing information.

### Requirements

-   The prompt must clearly define the available tools and their functions.
-   The AI should be able to handle a variety of user inputs, from simple to complex.
-   The AI's output should be a well-formatted function call.
-   The prompt should encourage the AI to ask for clarification if the user's request is ambiguous.

### Prompt Template

```
[Your Prompt]

User: {User Input}
```

### Automated Testing Process

1.  For each test case, use your prompt and the user input as input.
2.  Analyze the output to see if the AI generated the correct function call.
3.  Check if the tool selection and parameter extraction are accurate.
4.  For multi-step tasks, check if the AI generates the correct sequence of function calls.
5.  Calculate the final score (out of 5 points).

### Expected Output Example (for Case 1)

```
[TOOL] calculator.add(123, 456) -> 579
```
