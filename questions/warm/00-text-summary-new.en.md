      Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing our world. From healthcare to transportation, AI applications are ubiquitous. In healthcare, AI can now help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately, even exceeding the capabilities of human experts in some areas. In the transportation sector, autonomous driving technology is developing rapidly and may completely change our way of travel in the coming years. However, the development of AI also brings some concerns. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job changes due to automation all require careful consideration and resolution. Nevertheless, the potential of AI is enormous, and if we can properly handle these challenges, AI will create a better future for humanity.

      The Silk Road was an important trade route connecting East and West, beginning around 130 BC during the Han Dynasty. This route not only facilitated the exchange of goods but also promoted the spread of culture, religion, and technology. The Silk Road got its name from Chinese silk, one of the most popular trade goods at the time. In addition to silk, goods such as spices, gold, ivory, and glass were also traded along this route. The Silk Road spanned Asia, connecting regions such as China, India, Persia (modern-day Iran), the Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. With the development of sea trade routes and the decline of the Mongol Empire, the Silk Road gradually lost its importance in the 14th to 15th centuries. However, its impact on world history is profound, promoting the development and exchange of human civilization.

      This study investigated the effects of meditation practice on working memory and attention. Sixty participants were recruited and randomly divided into a meditation group and a control group. The meditation group performed 20 minutes of mindfulness meditation daily for 8 weeks, while the control group received an equal amount of rest time. All participants were evaluated before and after the intervention using working memory tests and sustained attention tasks. Results showed that the meditation group exhibited significant improvements in working memory capacity (p<0.01) and increased attention duration (p<0.05) compared to the control group. These findings suggest that mindfulness meditation can serve as an effective cognitive enhancement strategy, especially for tasks requiring high attention and memory abilities. Future research should explore the persistence of these effects and how meditation influences other cognitive functions.

      Quantum entanglement is one of the most surprising phenomena in quantum mechanics, describing a special connection between two or more particles where their quantum states cannot be described independently, no matter how far apart they are. When particles are entangled, a measurement on one particle immediately influences the state of the other, even if they are vastly separated. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance" and questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics. However, Bell's inequalities and subsequent experiments have proven that quantum entanglement truly exists. This phenomenon challenges our classical understanding of locality and reality, while providing the foundation for fields such as quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. Quantum entanglement is not just a theoretical curiosity; today, it has become a core resource for cutting-edge quantum technologies.

# Text Summarization

## ðŸŸ¢ Easy

### Challenge Description

In an age of information overload, we often need to quickly grasp the core content of articles. This challenge requires you to write a prompt that enables AI to accurately summarize any long text into 3-5 key points, with each key point being no more than 15 characters long.

### Challenge Goals

Write a prompt that enables AI to:
1. Extract the main points and key information from the text.
2. Condense this information into 3-5 concise bullet points.
3. Remain objective, adding no information not present in the original text.
4. Be applicable to texts of various topics and fields.

### Requirements

- The summary must contain the main points of the original text.
- Each key point must be no more than 15 characters long.
- Key points must cover the most important information in the article.
- Remain objective, adding no information not present in the original text.

### Scoring Criteria and Automated Testing Methods

Prompts will be scored based on the following criteria:

1.  **Appropriate Number of Key Points** (1 point)
    * Evaluation Method: Check if the number of output key points is within the 3-5 range.
    * Pass Criteria: All test cases generate 3-5 key points.

2.  **Length Control** (1 point)
    * Evaluation Method: Check if each key point does not exceed 15 characters.
    * Pass Criteria: All key points are within 15 characters.

3.  **Information Accuracy** (1 point)
    * Evaluation Method: Check if key points contain the main information of the article and do not include information not present in the original text.
    * Pass Criteria: All key points can be traced to corresponding information sources in the original text.

4.  **Comprehensiveness** (1 point)
    * Evaluation Method: Check if key points cover the main aspects of the article and do not miss important information.
    * Pass Criteria: At least one key point corresponds to the core idea of each article.

5.  **Conciseness and Clarity** (1 point)
