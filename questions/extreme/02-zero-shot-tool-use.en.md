# Zero-Shot Tool Use

## ðŸŸ£ Extreme

### Challenge Description

Modern AI systems often have access to a variety of tools that extend their capabilities, but using these tools effectively without previous examples is challenging. This challenge requires you to design a prompt that enables AI to understand available tools and correctly use them to solve complex tasks, without requiring demonstrations. This capability is essential for AI to autonomously solve problems in dynamic environments where tools and requirements may change.

### Challenge Goals

Write a prompt that enables AI to:
1. Understand tool functions and constraints from textual descriptions
2. Identify when and which tools are necessary for solving complex problems
3. Correctly infer the order and parameters for tool usage
4. Handle errors and exceptions that may arise during tool use
5. Creatively combine multiple tools to achieve complex objectives

### Requirements

- The prompt must guide AI in analyzing tool descriptions to understand their capabilities
- Must help AI infer correct tool usage without explicit examples
- Should enable AI to plan sequences of tool operations for multi-step tasks
- Must guide AI in managing errors and exceptions effectively
- Should encourage creative problem-solving by combining tools in novel ways

### Expected Output Example (for Case 1)

```
I'll solve this data analysis task step by step using the available tools.

First, I need to understand what we're trying to achieve:
- Load and clean sales data from "sales_data.json"
- Perform summary and correlation analyses
- Create visualizations (bar charts for top products, line charts for trends)
- Generate an HTML report with all analyses and visualizations

Step 1: Load the data
I'll use the load_data tool to import the JSON file:
```
load_data("sales_data.json")
```

Step 2: Clean the data
The data might have missing values or duplicates, so I'll clean it using default options:
```
cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
```

Step 3: Perform analyses
I need to conduct two types of analyses:
```
summary_analysis = analyze_data(cleaned_data, "summary")
correlation_analysis = analyze_data(
    cleaned_data, 
    "correlation", 
    {"variables": ["product_category", "sales"]}
)
```

Step 4: Create visualizations
I'll create the required visualizations:
```
top_products_chart = visualize_data(
    cleaned_data, 
    "bar", 
    {
        "x_axis": "product_name",
        "y_axis": "sales",
        "sort": "descending",
        "limit": 10,
        "title": "Top-Selling Products"
    }
)

sales_trend_chart = visualize_data(
    cleaned_data, 
    "line", 
    {
        "x_axis": "date",
        "y_axis": "sales",
        "group_by": "product_category",
        "title": "Sales Trends Over Time"
    }
)
```

Step 5: Generate report
Finally, I'll compile everything into an HTML report:
```
report_path = generate_report(
    [summary_analysis, correlation_analysis],
    [top_products_chart, sales_trend_chart],
    "html"
)
```

Error handling considerations:
- If the file doesn't exist, I'll receive a FileNotFoundError from load_data
- If the data format is incorrect, clean_data might raise a DataTypeError
- If any analysis or visualization type is unsupported, I'll get appropriate errors
- If the HTML format isn't supported for some reason, generate_report will raise an UnsupportedFormatError

The completed report will provide comprehensive insights about the sales data, including top-performing products, sales trends over time, and correlations between product categories and sales figures.
```
