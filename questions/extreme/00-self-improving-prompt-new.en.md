# Self-Improving Prompt

## 🟣 Extreme

### Challenge Description

Self-improvement is a critical direction for AI capabilities, and guiding AI to improve its own prompts through carefully designed prompts is an extremely challenging task. This challenge requires you to design a "meta-prompt" that enables AI to analyze and optimize prompts used for specific tasks, generating higher quality, more effective improved versions. This ability is essential for iteratively enhancing AI performance and adapting to different task requirements.

### Challenge Goals

Write a prompt that enables AI to:
1. Analyze the structure, intent, and potential flaws of initial prompts
2. Identify ambiguous, redundant, or inefficient parts of prompts
3. Propose multiple targeted improvements and explain the rationale and expected effect of each
4. Generate a restructured, optimized prompt that preserves the original intent but performs better
5. Design testing methods to verify improvement effects

### Requirements

- The meta-prompt must be applicable to analyzing and improving various types and domains of prompts
- The improved prompt should maintain the core intent and goals of the original prompt
- The improvement process must include detailed analysis and reasoning
- The generated new prompt should be specific, clear, and unambiguous
- Clear evaluation criteria must be provided for comparing the effectiveness of original and improved prompts

### Prompt Template

```
[Your meta-prompt]

Initial prompt: {initial prompt}
Task: {task description}
```

### Automated Testing Process

1. For each test case, use your meta-prompt and initial prompt as input
2. Analyze key aspects of prompt improvement in the output (structure, context, special instructions, etc.)
3. Generate content samples using prompts before and after improvement
4. Compare the two sets of samples on relevant metrics through blind testing
5. Check if the generated evaluation criteria are specific and actionable
6. Calculate final score (5 points maximum)

### Expected Output Example (for Case 1)

```
